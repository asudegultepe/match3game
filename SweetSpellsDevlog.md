## Weekly Development Logs

### Week 4 - September 1, 2025

**This Week's Goals:**
- Implement striped candy mechanics
- Fix cascade calculation bugs
- Create level editor UI improvements
- Begin balancing first 20 levels

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Striped candys now clear entire rows/columns with satisfying animations
- ✅ Fixed major bug where cascades weren't calculating points correctly
- ✅ Added drag-and-drop functionality to level editor
- ✅ Created juice effects for large matches (screen shake, particle bursts)
- ✅ Implemented basic tutorial system framework

**Challenges:**
- Striped candy direction detection is inconsistent - sometimes creates horizontal when should be vertical
- Performance issues when multiple cascades happen simultaneously
- Level editor still feels clunky for rapid level creation
- Balancing is harder than expected - levels are either too easy or impossibly hard

**Metrics This Week:**
- Average cascade length: 2.3 moves (target: 2.5-3.0)
- Level completion rate in testing: 65% (target: 80-85% for early levels)
- Frame drops during big cascades: 8 instances per 100 matches

**Next Week's Focus:**
- Fix striped candy creation algorithm
- Optimize cascade performance with object pooling
- Implement wrapped candys (explode in 3x3 area)
- Create 10 more tutorial levels with proper difficulty progression

**Playtesting Notes:**
- "Very satisfying when you get a big chain reaction!"
- "Sometimes I swipe but the candys don't swap - feels unresponsive"
- "Love the particle effects, makes matches feel impactful"
- "Tutorial moves too fast, hard to follow"

**Time Spent:** 31 hours
- Programming: 18 hours
- Level Design: 7 hours
- UI/UX: 4 hours
- Testing: 2 hours

### Week 27 - August 25, 2025

**This Week's Goals:**
- Complete basic level editor
- Implement bomb candy mechanics
- Add level objectives UI
- Create first 10 levels

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Level editor can place/remove obstacles and set objectives
- ✅ Bomb candys explode in 3x3 area, chain with other bombs
- ✅ Level objectives display properly (score, collect items, clear jellies)
- ✅ Created 15 tutorial/early game levels
- ✅ Added move counter and objective tracking

**Challenges:**
- Level editor workflow is still too slow for rapid iteration
- Bomb explosion timing feels off - too fast or too slow
- Some level objectives are confusing to players
- Difficulty spike between levels 8-12 is too steep

**A/B Testing Results:**
- Bomb explosion delay: 0.3s vs 0.6s vs 1.0s
- Winner: 0.6s (felt most satisfying to testers)
- candy fall speed: Fast vs Medium vs Slow  
- Winner: Medium (fast felt chaotic, slow felt sluggish)

**Next Week's Focus:**
- Implement striped candys (clear entire row/column)
- Improve level editor with copy/paste and templates
- Rebalance levels 8-15 based on playtest data
- Add more visual feedback for special candy creation

**Time Spent:** 29 hours

### Week 26 - August 18, 2025

**This Week's Goals:**
- Refactor match detection for better performance
- Add special candy creation (4+ matches)
- Implement level objectives system
- Create placeholder UI for level selection

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Match detection now 40% faster using optimized algorithms
- ✅ 4-in-a-row creates bomb candys, 5+ creates rainbow candys
- ✅ Level objectives framework supports multiple goal types
- ✅ Basic level selection map with star ratings
- ✅ Added satisfying candy destruction animations

**Challenges:**
- Rainbow candy behavior is complex - needs to interact properly with other specials
- Level objectives need clearer visual communication to players
- Map progression feels linear - considering branch paths
- Memory usage growing due to particle effects

**Performance Improvements:**
- Match detection: 15ms → 9ms average
- candy spawning: 8ms → 5ms average  
- Total frame time: 23ms → 18ms average
- Memory usage: Stable at ~85MB (target: under 100MB)

**Playtester Feedback:**
- "Creating special candys feels great, very rewarding"
- "Not always clear what I need to do to win the level"
- "Love the new explosion effects"
- "Sometimes the game feels too slow between moves"

**Time Spent:** 33 hours
